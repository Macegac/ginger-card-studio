# Ginger Card Studio

A mobile-first character card editor that runs entirely in the browser. One HTML file, no
build step, no server.

## What it does

- **Import** character cards — Character Card V2/V3 (PNG or JSON), Ginger cards, Agnai,
  Pygmalion, Text Generation WebUI YAML. Drag-drop or file picker.
- **Edit** every card field: description, personality, scenario, first message, example
  messages, system prompt, post-history instructions, creator notes, tags, portrait.
- **Alternate greetings** with slot reordering.
- **Lorebook** editor — keys and content per entry.
- **Recipes** — cards saved by [Ginger](https://github.com/DominaeDev/ginger) carry their
  recipe stack. It's shown read-only with the values you set, and preserved byte-for-byte
  on export.
- **AI assist** via OpenRouter — build a whole card from a one-line concept, or
  rewrite / expand / condense / fix any field. Every change is previewed against the
  current text and applied only when you accept it.
- **Undo / redo**, 80 steps. Typing coalesces into single steps.
- **Revert** any field to the value the card was imported with.
- **Export** as a Character Card V2 PNG or JSON.

## Your data

Cards live in your browser's IndexedDB and never leave the device — except the single
field you send when you press an AI button. There is no backend.

Your OpenRouter key is stored in `localStorage` on your device only. It is never part of
the page source. Use a credit-limited key.

On iOS, browser storage can be cleared under storage pressure or after long disuse, so
treat the library as a working set and export anything you want to keep.

## Diagnostics

[`probe.html`](https://macegac.github.io/ginger-card-studio/probe.html) checks whether a
given device supports what the app needs — chiefly `DecompressionStream`, which is
required to read Ginger's compressed recipe chunk (Safari 16.4+).
